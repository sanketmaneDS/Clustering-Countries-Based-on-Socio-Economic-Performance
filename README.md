# Clustering-Countries-Based-on-Socio-Economic-Performance

Built a Clustering model based on algorithms of Hierarchical clustering, K Means
which segregates 182 countries of the world into separate clusters such as
developed, developing, under developed etc. according to their socio-economic
performance.
While performing EDA dealt with 11.7k missing values with the help of imputation
by SLR, KNN imputer, median and insertion, deletion.
Dataset and output of clustering model was then used to train a Classification
model which predicts development status of given country with 93% accuracy.
Deployed model using streamlit.
